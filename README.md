A header-only, STL-like library for node-type data structures that are not natively supported by **STL**. All headers are documented using Doxygen comments. <br>
Currently - all supported data structures and class are [here](https://github.com/SleepiCaffeine/Data-Structures-CPP/blob/main/status.md).

## How to use
Simply include `data_structues.hpp` or any individual header, and start using it. If you are unsure how to clone a repository - [read here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository). At the end, I hope to add a doxygen generated PDF to show the full documentation.

## Issues and Pull Requests
